# üß† ILL-Protocol-v1: Image Language Library for GPT-4

This project enables **ChatGPT 4.0 with Python tools** to use a **curated visual meme library** as inline emotional responses ‚Äî based on the meaning of your prompt, not just keywords.

**ILL** stands for **Image Language Library** ‚Äî a small but powerful set of images that respond to emotional intent (e.g., validation, motivation, sarcasm) using Python-rendered image blocks.

Created by [DaTechDad](https://datechdad.com) to make AI responses more expressive, relatable, and fun ‚Äî without relying on hallucination-prone generation.
